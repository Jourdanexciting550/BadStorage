/*
	The RDFC patch updates FatxProcessBootSector to always use a value of 1 for the root directory first cluster.
	FATXplorer formats Bad Storage Content Partitions with a value of 0, which will cause the retail kernel to think the root directory is corrupt. This is important because we don't want the retail kernel to add anything to the partition before Bad Storage is executed.
	The original design was to use a larger sectors per cluster to get the retail kernel to think the partition is "Unformatted" but this resulted in the system not loading the avatar partitions.

	The DID patch temporarily overrides XContent::DeviceAssignDeviceId to give the HDD its original device ID value (1) when XContent::DeviceProcessAddRemove (add) is called.
	This is important to fix the issue where the avatar update would not install.
